            <h2>Listening in</h2>
            <span>
              A state of calm, desired silence and solitude, allowing one to
              regain balance and gather strength before diving again into the
              omnipresent chaos.

            <h2>Ravens</h2>
            <span>
              The ravens symbolize the connection between the natural and the
              spiritual realms, as well as the wisdom and mystery of nature. The
              roots form an unseen world in nature and represent my
              introversion.

            <span>
              His body, a mysterious intertwining of bark and foliage, rises
              from the ground, one with nature and its immortal cycles. Leshen's
              eyes, glowing like emeralds, reflect infinite wisdom and a deep
              understanding of nature's mystical paths.
